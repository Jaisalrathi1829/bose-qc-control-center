//! This module is the enforcement point for the project's hardware truth rule:
//! a feature is never described as working because a UI exists for it, because
//! a command was accepted, or because documentation says it should. It is

//!
//! The rules here are mirrored in TypeScript at
//! `app/frontend/src/types/capability.ts`. Both sides are tested.
